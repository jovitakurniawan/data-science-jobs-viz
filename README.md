## Background
I was curious to see how the different data science related roles are distributed across the globe. With the dataset I obtained from Kaggle, I built a dashboard to show the distribution of data science related roles across the globe, where do companies who hire these data science people come from and how the salary are broken down by various factors (location, employment type, seniority level, and working mode). Hopefully, this will provide me and similar individuals who are learning data science a better understanding of data science employment across the globe.
